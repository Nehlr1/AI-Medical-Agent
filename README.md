```

### Configuration Constants

```python
class Config:
    MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_MB = 10          # Maximum file size
    MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS = 10_000_000   # Maximum image resolution
    SEARCH_DELAY_SECONDS = 1        # Delay between API calls
    PUBMED_MAX_RESULTS = 5          # Number of search results
    GEMINI_MODEL = "gemini-2.0-flash"  # AI model version
    TEMPERATURE = 0.1               # Model creativity (0-1)
```
